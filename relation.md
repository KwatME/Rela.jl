Yolk Sac =function=> Erythropoiesis

Marrow =function=> Erythropoiesis

Liver =function=> Erythropoiesis

Spleen =function=> Erythropoiesis

Kidney =make=> EPO

##

RBC =contain=> Hg

Erythropoiesis ==> "10 days after the birth, [erythroblast] reaches the maximum. Erythropoiesis slows down and results in physiological anemia. EPO increases in response and restimulate the erythropoiesis."

Hg =contain=> ⍺ Globulin, β Globulin, δ Globulin, ɣ Globulin

HgA ==> "98% of Hg is this."
HgA ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 β globulins."
HgA =contain=> ⍺ Globulin, β Globulin

HgA2 ==> "2% of Hg is this."
HgA2 ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 δ globulins."
HgA2 =contain=> ⍺ Globulin, δ Globulin

HgF ==> "This has higher affinity for O2 than HgA does."
HgF ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 ɣ globulins."
HgF =contain=> ⍺ Globulin, ɣ Globulin

⍺ Globulin ==> "There are 4 copies of this gene. Loss of function in 4 is embryonically lethal."
⍺ Globulin ==> "Unpaired ⍺ globulin is toxic."
⍺ Globulin =lof=> ⍺ Thalassemia

β Globulin =lof=> β Thalassemia

δ Globulin ==> "Role of this may be to bind to unpaired ⍺ globulin."

β Globulin Variant =snv=> HgS, HgC, HgE

HgS =make=> Sickle Cell

Sickle Cell ==> "This is sticky, carries less O2, and lives shorter. But this is resistant to Plasmodium infection."
