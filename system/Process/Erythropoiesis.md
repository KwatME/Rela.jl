Erythropoiesis ==> "This happens around a macrophage."

Erythropoiesis ==> "Breathing brings in more O2 in a newborn and this increase in O2 slows down erythropoiesis. [erythroblast] reaches the maximum 10 days after birth and a physiologic anemia follows. In response, EPO increases and restimulates erythropoiesis."

Erythropoiesis ==> "When Hg drops below 8, a normal marrow response elevates reticulocyte above 8, which indicates absolute reticulocyte to be above 150K."

Erythropoiesis =Decrease=> Fe++

Erythropoiesis ==> "Without erythropoiesis, Hg decreases 1mg/week. If it declines faster, bleeding or hemolysis may be happening."

Erythroblast =Contain=> Transferrin Receptor, Ferritin

Erythroblast =Become=> Reticulocyte

Reticulocyte ==> "This lacks nucleus."

Reticulocyte ==> "This develops in the marrow for 3 days, exits the marrow, circulates in the blood for 1 day, and becomes a RBC."

Reticulocyte ==> "2% of RBC is reticulocyte."

Reticulocyte =Become=> Spherocyte, RBC
