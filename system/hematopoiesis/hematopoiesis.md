Hematopoiesis ==> "Chromosome condenses with development."

Hematopoiesis =Classify=> Myelopoiesis, Lymphopoiesis

Myelopoiesis ==> "Granulopoiesis starts near the bone and moves away from it with development. Granules increase with development. (Bone may be the source of the chemicals stored in the granules.)"

Hematopoietic Stem Cell =Become=> Myeloid Progenitor Cell, Lymphoid Progenitor Cell

##

Myeloid Progenitor Cell =Become=> Basophilic Band, Neutrophilic Band, Eosinophilic Band, Monocyte, Erythroblast, Megakaryocyte

##

Lymphoid Progenitor Cell =Become=> NKC, Pre-T Cell, Pre-B Cell

##

Pre-T Cell =Become=> Naive T Cell

##

Naive T Cell =Become=> Helper T Cell, Cytotoxic T Cell

##

Pre-B Cell =Contain=> PAX, TDT

Pre-B Cell =Become=> Naive B Cell

##

Naive B Cell =Contain=> CD20

Naive B Cell =Go=> Lymphnode

Naive B Cell =Become=> B Cell

##

B Cell =Contain=> CD20

B Cell =Become=> Effector B Cell

##

Effector B Cell =Contain=> Plasma B Cell, Memory B Cell

##


Basophilic Band =Become=> Basophil

Neutrophilic Band =Become=> Neutrophil

Eosinophilic Band =Become=> Eosinophil

##

Monocytopoiesis =Make=> Monocyte

Monocyte =Become=> Macrophage, Dendritic Cell

##

Erythropoiesis ==> "This happens around a macrophage."

Erythropoiesis ==> "Breathing brings in more O2 in a newborn and this increase in O2 slows down erythropoiesis. [erythroblast] reaches the maximum 10 days after birth and a physiologic anemia follows. In response, EPO increases and restimulates erythropoiesis."

Erythropoiesis ==> "When Hg drops below 8, a normal marrow response elevates reticulocyte above 8, which indicates absolute reticulocyte to be above 150K."

Erythropoiesis =Decrease=> Fe++

Erythropoiesis ==> "Without erythropoiesis, Hg decreases 1mg/week. If it declines faster, bleeding or hemolysis may be happening."

Erythroblast =Contain=> Transferrin Receptor, Ferritin

Erythroblast =Become=> Reticulocyte

Reticulocyte ==> "This lacks nucleus."

Reticulocyte ==> "This develops in the marrow for 3 days, exits the marrow, circulates in the blood for 1 day, and becomes a RBC."

Reticulocyte ==> "2% of RBC is reticulocyte."

Reticulocyte =Become=> Spherocyte, RBC

##

Thrombopoiesis ==> "This happens around a sinusoid."

Megakaryocyte ==> "This develops with endomitosis. Ploidity ranges from 4 to 64. Increased demand increases ploidity."

Megakaryocyte =Become=> Platelet

##

Lymphopoiesis ==> "This completes not in the marrow but in thymus or lymphnode."

WBC =Classify=> Neutrophil, Lymphocyte
