##

Hematopoiesis ==> "Chromosome condenses with development."

Hematopoiesis =Classify=> Granulopoiesis, Monocytopoiesis, Erythropoiesis, Thrombopoiesis, Lymphopoiesis

HSC =Become=> MPC, LPC

MPC =Become=> Basophilic Band, Neutrophilic Band, Eosinophilic Band, Monocyte, Erythroblast, Megakaryocyte

LPC =Bec=> NKC, Naive T Cell, Naive B Cell

##

Granulopoiesis ==> "This starts near the bone and moves away from it with development. Granules increase with development. (Bone may be the source of the chemicals stored in the granules.)"

Basophilic Band =Become=> Basophil

Neutrophilic Band =Become=> Neutrophil

Eosinophilic Band =Become=> Eosinophil

##

Monocytopoiesis =Make=> Monocyte

Monocyte =Become=> Macrophage, Dendritic Cell

##

Erythropoiesis ==> "This happens around a macrophage."

Erythropoiesis ==> "Breathing brings in more O2 in a newborn and this increase in O2 slows down erythropoiesis. [erythroblast] reaches the maximum 10 days after birth and a physiologic anemia follows. In response, EPO increases and restimulates erythropoiesis."

Erythropoiesis ==> "When Hg drops below 8, a normal marrow response elevates reticulocyte above 8, which indicates absolute reticulocyte to be above 150K."

Erythropoiesis =Decrease=> Fe++

Erythropoiesis ==> "Without erythropoiesis, Hg decreases 1mg/week. If it declines faster, bleeding or hemolysis may be happening."

Erythroblast =Contain=> Transferrin Receptor, Ferritin

Erythroblast =Become=> Reticulocyte

Reticulocyte ==> "This lacks nucleus."

Reticulocyte ==> "This develops in the marrow for 3 days, exits the marrow, circulates in the blood for 1 day, and becomes a RBC."

Reticulocyte ==> "2% of RBC is reticulocyte."

Reticulocyte =Become=> Spherocyte, RBC

##

Thrombopoiesis ==> "This happens around a sinusoid."

Megakaryocyte ==> "This develops with endomitosis. Ploidity ranges from 4 to 64. Increased demand increases ploidity."

Megakaryocyte =Become=> Platelet

##

Lymphopoiesis ==> "This completes not in the marrow but in thymus or lymphnode."

WBC =Classify=> Neutrophil, Lymphocyte
