Ferroportin =Export=> Fe++, Fe+++

##

Ferritin =Bind=> Fe++

Ferritin =Become=> Hemosiderin

##

Transferrin ==> "When Fe++ decreases, this increases to scavenge Fe++."

Transferrin ==> "Its saturation decreases when increases in its production is more than increase in Fe++."

Transferrin =Bind=> Fe++, Transferrin Receptor

Transferrin Receptor ==> "When Fe++ decreases, this increases to better receive Fe++."

##

Hepcidin =Decrease=> Ferroportin

##

Hemosiderin =Bind=> Fe++

Hemosiderin =Increase=> Urine Brown

##

Hepatoglobin =Bind=> Hg

##

IL3 =Increase=> Erythropoiesis

IL6 =Increase=> Erythropoiesis

GSF-GM =Increase=> Erythropoiesis

EPO =Increase=> Erythropoiesis

##

CD47 =Decrease=> T Cell Response

Phosphatidyl Serine =Increae=> Apoptosis

##

G6PD ==> "Its gene is on X chromosome."

G6PD ==> "Measuring this in RBCs require taking out RBCs and lysing them to expose G6PDs for counting. In an acute setting, RBCs that had variant G6PD have died, so G6PD measure results in falsely low value."

G6PD =LowIncrease=> Hemolysis

##

vWF =Increase=> Thrombosis

vWF =Decrease=> Platelet

##

ADAMTS13 =LowIncrease=> Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

##

Antibody =Decrease=> RBC, Platelet

Antibody =Contain=> FC

Antibody =Classify=> Anti-Human Antibody

FC =Increase=> Macrophage Function

Anti-Human Antibody ==> "This binds to the FC of any human antibody and is used to see if human antibodies are bound to something. In Coombs test, this is used to see if human antibodies are binding to RBCs."

##

Anti-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor =Increase=> Myasthenia Gravis

Anti-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor =Decrease=> Neuromuscular Junction

##

MHC ==> "HLA"

MHC ==> "MHC matched allograft from an unrelated donor is as good as from a relative."
