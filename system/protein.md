Ferroportin =Export=> Fe++, Fe+++

##

Ferritin =Bind=> Fe++

Ferritin =Become=> Hemosiderin

##

Transferrin ==> "When Fe++ decreases, this increases to scavenge Fe++."

Transferrin ==> "Its saturation decreases when increases in its production is more than increase in Fe++."

Transferrin =Bind=> Fe++, Transferrin Receptor

Transferrin Receptor ==> "When Fe++ decreases, this increases to better receive Fe++."

##

Hepcidin =Decrease=> Ferroportin

EPO =Increase=> Erythropoiesis

##

CD47 =Decrease=> T Cell Response

Phosphatidyl Serine =Increae=> Apoptosis

##

G6PD ==> "Its gene is on X chromosome."

G6PD ==> "Measuring this in RBCs require taking out RBCs and lysing them to expose G6PDs for counting. In an acute setting, RBCs that had variant G6PD have died, so G6PD measure results in falsely low value."

G6PD =LowIncrease=> Hemolysis

##

vWF =Increase=> Thrombosis

vWF =Decrease=> Platelet

##

ADAMTS13 =LowIncrease=> Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

ADAMTS13 =Decrease=> vWF

##

Antibody =Decrease=> RBC, Platelet

Antibody =Contain=> FC

Antibody =Classify=> Anti-Human Antibody

FC =Increase=> Macrophage Function

Anti-Human Antibody ==> "This binds to the FC of any human antibody and is used to see if human antibodies are bound to something. In Coombs test, this is used to see if human antibodies are binding to RBCs."

##

Bilirubin Unconjugated =Become=> Bilirubin Conjugated

Bilirubin Conjugated =Increase=> Gallstone Pigmented

Bilirubin Conjugated =Increase=> Scleral Icterus

##

Anti-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor =Increase=> Myasthenia Gravis

Anti-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor =Decrease=> Neuromuscular Junction

##

MHC ==> "HLA"

MHC ==> "MHC matched allograft from an unrelated donor is as good as from a relative."

MHC ==> "There is less recombination in the MHC genomic regions, so 1/4 of siblings have the identical sequence."

##

ABL =Increase=> Leukemia

##

BRAF =Increase=> Hairy Cell Leukemia

##

BCR ==> "B cell receptor"

BCR =Contain=> Heavy Chain, Light Chain

Heavy Chain =Classify=> IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD

Hemoglobin ==> "90% RBC weight."

RBC =Contain=> 2,3BPG

RBC ==( "ABO antigens are carbohydrates and Rh antigens are proteins. They develop by few months old. Under normal circumstances, an antigen and its antibody do not coexist. People with blood type O have RBC lacking both A and B antigens and have anti-RBC A and B, so they are universal RBC donors. People with blood type AB have RBCs with both A and B antigens and lack antibodies against them, so they are universal plasma donors. Direct antiglobulin test mixes a person's things with its own things. Indirect antiglobulin test mixes a person's things with testing things. Forward typing is an indirect typing to test a patient's RBC. Reverse typing is in indirect typing to test patient's antibodies. Anti-D is an IgG that can cross placenta. It binds to Rh."

Blood == "Fresh frozen plasma has all coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitate has factor 8, fibrinogen, and vWF. If possible, give only what is missing. Give RBC if it is below 7. 1 RBC unit adds 1. Give platelet if it is below 10. 1 platelet unit adds 50. Give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is below 100. 10 fibrinogen units add 100. FFP is becoming increasingly unpopular. 1ml/kg FFP adds 1%."

TRALI == "1% of all transfusions. Anti-MHC or anti-neutrophil antibodies attack the lungs and cause ARDS."

TRALI =/\=> O2, Blood Pressure

TACO == "More common than TRALI. Volume overload."
