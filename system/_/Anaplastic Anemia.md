Anaplastic Anemia ==> "This is caused by insults to marrow or hematopoietic stem cells."

##

Fanconi Anemia ==> "This is an anaplastic anemia cuased by loss-of-function in DNA repair proteins. As a result, the chromosomes of the hematopoietic cells are fragile."

Fanconi Anemia ==> "Onset is 3-10 year old."

Fanconi Anemia =Decrease=> Hematopoiesis

##

Diamond-Blackfan Anemia ==> "This is an anaplastic anemia cuased by problems in ribosomes, associated with loss-of-function variant in RPS19 gene."

Diamond-Blackfan Anemia =Decrease=> Erythropoiesis

Diamond-Blackfan Anemia =Increase=> Macrocytic Anemia

##

Virus ==> "Virus suppresses hematopoiesis more in children."

Virus =Decrease=> Hematopoiesis
