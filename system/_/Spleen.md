Spleen ==> "Its arterioles have open ends so the blood content spills. T cells surround the arterioles and make the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath. The spilled content meets the T cells first and then must squeeze through the splenic slits of 2Âµm in order to reach venules. Big things and inflexible things fail to squeeze through and are phagocytosed by macrophages."

Spleen ==> "Without this, various shaped RBCs show up in the peripheral blood smear."

Spleen ==> "B cell follicles surround the splenic slits and make the marginal zone."
