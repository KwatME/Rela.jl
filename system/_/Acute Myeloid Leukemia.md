Myelodysplastic Syndromes ==> "Marrow failure. Slow onset. Incidence increases with age."

Myelodysplastic Syndromes =Become=> Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Myelodysplastic Syndromes =Increase=> Macrocytic Anemia

Myelodysplastic Syndromes =Decrease=> Granulopoiesis, Erythropoiesis, Thrombopoiesis

Myelodysplastic Syndromes ==> "Neutrophil: abnormal lobules and granules. RBC: macroovalocytes in the blood and sideroblasts in the marrow. Platelet: small megakaryocytes with less lobules and granules and big platelets."

##

Acute Myeloid Leukemia ==> "Variable degree of differentiation."

Acute Myeloid Leukemia ==> "Rapid onset and death."

Acute Myeloid Leukemia ==> "Myelodysplasia being 20% of the marrow or the blood; the presence of specific mutation; or myeloid sarcoma."

Acute Myeloid Leukemia =Decrease=> Hematopoiesis

Acute Myeloid Leukemia ==> "Treat low risk patients with chemotherapy and high risk with additional stem cell transplant. Treat old patients with palliative care."
