Lymphnode ==> "This has 2 input and 1 output. Lymphatic inflow brings in antigens, which are taken up by follicular dendridic cells. Arterial inflow brings in naive B cells. Each naive B cell has 1 kind of B cell receptor. If a follicular dendridic cell presents the antigen that matches the specific kind of B cell receptor of a naive B cell, then the dendridic cell activates the naive B cell to become B cell. B cells and naive B cells exit the lymphnode via venous outflow."

Lymphnode ==> "This is filled with helper T cells and macrophages. Near the lymphatic sinusoids are follicles. A follicle is naive B cells surrounded by mantle B cells. The antigens from the sinusoids travel to the follicles. If a naive B cell meets the antigen that can bind to its B cell receptor, this naive B cell matures into a B cell. Mantle B cells and helper T cells help the maturation."
