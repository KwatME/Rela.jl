##

Megakaryocyte ==> "Mostly in the marrow and some in the lungs. Matures in 5 days. Fused nuclei. Mean ploidity 16N. Maximum ploidity 64N. Becomes 1000s of platelets. Increases platelet production by increasing the ploidity."

TPO =Increase=> Megakaryocyte

Platelet =Decrease=> TPO

Liver, Kidney, Smooth Muscle Cell, Endothelial Cell, Fibroblast, Marrow ==> TPO

TPO ==> "Similar to EPO."

Platelet ==> "Lives for 8 days. Young platelets are bigger. As they circulate, they bump into things and chip away, becoming smaller. 2/3 circulating. 1/6 attached to spleen. 1/6 attached to non-spleen places. Epinephrine releases attached platelet."

Evans Syndrome =Increase=> ITP, Hemolysis

ITP, Organomegaly, Infection, Cancer =Decrease=> Platelet

Thrombocytopenia ==> "Associated with congenital syndromes like thrombocytopenia absent radii syndrome and Fanconi anemia. Decreased production is rare."

##

Antibody =Increase=> Macrophage Function

##

ITP ==> "Anti-platelet. Platelet lives for hours. In people less than 1 year old, ITP is often post infection, triggered by platelet mimicry by the pathogen. Remove spleen if chronic. Treat with immunosuppression and anti-CD20."

ITP =Increase=> Anti-Platelet, DIC

##

HIT ==> "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 5% of thrombocytopenia. Rapid 50% drop in platelet. Diagnose with scoring: thrombocytopenia, timing, thrombosis, and other cause. HIT until proven otherwise."

Anti-ADAMTS13 =Increase=> TTP

TTP ==> "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura."

TTP =Increase=> Hemolysis

TTP ==> "Plasmapheresis."

##

NAIT ==> "Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Newborn's platelet activates the mother's immune system, which then goes after all platelets."

##

PTP ==> "Post transfusion purpura. Recipient's immune system goes after transfused platelets."
