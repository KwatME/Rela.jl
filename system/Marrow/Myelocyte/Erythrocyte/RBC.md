# "

Does not have nucleus.




##

RBC ==> "Its high membrane-to-cytoplasm ratio allows it to change its shape and squeeze through narrow paths. Inflexible RBCs fail to squeeze through the splenic slits and are phagocytosed by macrophages."

RBC ==> "Its cytosol is reducing and Fe+++ is reduced to Fe++."

RBC =LowIncrease=> Anemia, Ferritin

RBC =Contain=> Hg, CD47, G6PD, LDH, Bilirubin Unconjugated

RBC =Increase=> Hematocrit

RBC ==> "This lives for 120 days."

RBC ==> "8µm"

RBC =Function=> Glycolysis

Hematocrit ==> "This does not go above 56%."

##

Hg =Bind=> O₂

Hg =Contain=> ⍺ Globulin, β Globulin, δ Globulin, ɣ Globulin, Fe++, Fe+++, Hemichrome, Heinz Body

Hg =Become=> Hemichrome

Hemichrome =Become=> Heinz Body

##

HgA ==> "98% of Hg is this."

HgA ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 β globulins."

HgA =Contain=> ⍺ Globulin, β Globulin

##

HgA2 ==> "2% of Hg is this."

HgA2 ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 δ globulins."

HgA2 =Contain=> ⍺ Globulin, δ Globulin

##

HgF ==> "This has higher affinity for O2 than HgA does."

HgF ==> "This is made of 2 ⍺ globulins and 2 ɣ globulins."

HgF =Contain=> ⍺ Globulin, ɣ Globulin

##

⍺ Globulin ==> "There are 4 copies of this gene. Loss of function in 4 is embryonically lethal."

⍺ Globulin ==> "Unpaired ⍺ globulin is toxic."

⍺ Globulin =LowIncrease=> ⍺ Thalassemia

##

β Globulin =LowIncrease=> β Thalassemia

β Globulin =Variant=> HgS, HgC, HgE

##

HgS ==> "Heterozygous variant is asymptomatic. Most people with sickle cell do not know that they have it."

HgS =Make=> Sickle Cell

Sickle Cell =Increase=> Hemolysis, Pain, Inflammation

Sickle Cell =Decrease=> Plasmodium, NO, Life

Sickle Cell ==> "This results in a neither concentrated or dilute urine with specific gravity 1.010."

##

HgC =Increase=> Hemolysis, Anemia

HgC =Decrease=> Plasmodium, Life

##

HgE =Increase=> Hemolysis, Anemia

HgE =Decrease=> Plasmodium, Life

##

δ Globulin ==> "Role of this may be to bind to unpaired ⍺ globulin."
