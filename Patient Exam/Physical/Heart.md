## Measure radial pulse

(Systolic blood pressure of at least 80 leads to radial pulse.)

## Measure blood pressure

## Measure jagular venous pulsation

Have patient angle at 45 degrees and turn head to the left, measure distance from sternal angle to pulsation.

5cm + distance should be less than 10cm.

## Check carotid pulse

(Systolic blood pressure of at least 60 leads to carotid pulse.)

One side at a time, feel artery.

One side at a time, have patient take a deep breath and hold, and (bell) auscultate artery.

## Check heart

Feel apex (point of maximal impact), which is palpable only in 25% of adults.

(Diaphram) auscultate LLSB, LICS2, apex, and RICS2.

Bell is good at hearing low frequency sounds of S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.

(Bell) auscultate apex.

## Check peripheral pulse

Brachial artery

Popliteal artery

Distal tibial artery

Dorsalis pedis artery

## Check edema

Push distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.
Measure respiratory rate

Feel back chest movement with both hands (deep breath)

Percuss back at 3 levels from lung apex to base

(Diaphram) listen back at 3 levels from lung apex to base (deep breath)

(Diaphram) listen the mid-axillary line at 2 levels (deep breath)

(Diaphram) listen the superior clavicular area (deep breath)

(Diaphram) listen the superior diaphram area (deep breath)
